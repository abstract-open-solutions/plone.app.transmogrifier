- Create more sections:

  - references

    - For archetypes-field managed references, a path resolver would suffice,
      as ReferenceField and ReverseReferenceField take objects or UIDs.

- Define a 'default import pipeline' variable in the transmogrifier section,
  so you can include a default set of sections that'll work for 95% of the
  transmogrifier import cases. The goal is to have a pipeline definition like
  this::

    include = plone.app.transmogrifier.config:ploneimport.cfg
    pipeline =
        my.specific.import.section
        ${ploneimport:importpipeline}

  With a black box section that could even be done without variable
  substitution.

- Improve userconstructor section:

  plone.app.transmogrifier.userconstructor is very simple, it allows to create
  a user and set his full name and email. A better approach might be to split
  this blueprint into two independent blueprints:

    - userconstructor which is responsible for create a user with the couple
      username/password.

    - userpropertiesupdater which is responsible to update the member's properties.
